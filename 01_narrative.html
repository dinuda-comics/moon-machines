        <p>01 Entering our world at March 2022 we notice there are some similarities with real events. There is a COVID-like unease but with a feel of normalcy: the world appears functional; yet it is severely infected by a pandemic. We experience there is isolation and latent unease in the world before introducing the characters. The place our story begins is in New Delhi, and specifically Chaitanya Research Pvt. Ltd. (a fictional organization that works in neuroscience).</p>
        <p>02 The BCI laboratory is a calm and controlled, clinical space where we meet JAGAN SHAH in his fatigued state in emotional proximity to the experiment. He has been working late studying the brain waves of an animal subject (a chimpanzee). There are patters JAGAN wants to see but the experiment is just not going right. He takes his notebook and goes for a walk on the rooftop.</p>
        <p>03 JAGAN’s inner struggle and intellectual obsession becomes visible through his notebook, as he talks to himself thinking out loud and searching for clues. Suddenly his mobile rings.</p>
        <p>04 It's PALAK SHAH on the other side, JAGAN's wife calling from home. She looks sick as her mouth and nose are covered by a nebulizer mask. Listening to the conversation, a quiet marital tension emerges. No overt conflict, though. Just two intelligent adults speaking past each other. The domestic fragility contrasts with JAGAN's intellectual obsession.</p>
