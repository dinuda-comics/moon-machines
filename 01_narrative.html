        <p>01 Entering our world at March 2022 we notice there are some similarities with real events. There is a COVID-like unease but with a feel of normalcy: the world appears functional; yet it is severely infected by a pandemic. We experience there is isolation and latent unease in the world before introducing the characters. The place our story begins is in New Delhi, and specifically Chaitanya Research Pvt. Ltd. (a fictional organization that works in neuroscience).</p>
        <p>02 The BCI laboratory is a calm and controlled, clinical space where we meet JAGAN SHAH in his fatigued state in emotional proximity to the experiment. He has been working late studying the brain waves of an animal subject (a chimpanzee). There are patters JAGAN wants to see but the experiment is just not going right. He takes his notebook and goes for a walk on the rooftop.</p>
        <p>03 JAGAN’s inner struggle and intellectual obsession with machine consciousness (MC) becomes visible through his notebook, as he talks to himself thinking out loud and searching for clues. At this point, it's unclear what MC is. Suddenly his mobile rings.</p>
        <p>04 It's PALAK SHAH on the other side, JAGAN's wife calling from home. She looks sick as her mouth and nose are covered by a nebulizer mask. Listening to the conversation, a quiet marital tension emerges. No overt conflict, though. Just two intelligent adults speaking past each other. The domestic fragility contrasts with JAGAN's intellectual obsession.</p>
        <p>05 UMANG, their teenage son sits beside PALAK, small but alert, holding a digital thermometer. PALAK has a fever but it remains unclear what her ailment is. She can keep a clear head under pressure and has a gift for organizing chaos, both domestic or scientific. Her biotech background gives her just enough fluency to challenge JAGAN’s tunnel-vision translating his abstractions into practical choices. She helps JAGAN think through his difficulty with today's experiment not going right.</p>
        <p>06 PALAK tries to be supportive, but there's limit to that. As her husband expresses obsession, a frustrated, almost angry, PALAK fires back and hangs up. Descending stairs, JAGAN is reminded of his friend ROHIL from MAL (Machine Applications Laboratory, Ahmedabad) who may be able to help him. Returning to the lab, a sound from inside creates alarm that something started happening while he was away.</p>
        <p>07 As JAGAN enters BCI lab, PALAK’s optimism turns real. What he sees lands as a cognitive shock to JAGAN marking a tonal shift towards psychological thrill.</p>
        <p>08 JAGAN collapses into a chair in response to an undeniable proof of success. Yet, instead of confusion, his rationality and scientific method shines as he tries to grasp what is happening: he sits down to analyze the neural data from the chimpanzee streaming across the monitor. What looks true may not always be true.</p>
        <p>09 JAGAN does not yet 'understand' what happened; he identifies 'what must be explained'. Overcoming emotional collapse by structured scientific curiosity, he establishes a working hypothesis inspired by PALAK's view point. Science begins not with answers, but with isolating root cause for further study.</p>
        <p>10 JAGAN finds out the vending machine (VM) dispensed the banana as if instruction came from a human using standard voice input. The investigation gains precision. The 'how' begins to take shape. He notices alignment signatures in the MC. The VM appears to have successfully interpreted signal from the chimpanzee.</p>
        <p>11 This demonstrates that the chimpanzee’s desire itself is the activating variable which the VM understands. It is a conceptual breakthrough and an inciting incident in our story. Thought is no longer abstract; it is operational. Can subjective intent be encoded in a form intelligible to machines? We wonder if consciousness is not just internal experience; it produces structured, interpretable outputs.</p>
        <p>12 JAGAN articulates the mechanism: intent -> neural coherence -> machine interpretation. The experimental loop closes and a thought crosses his mind: If an animal can do this unintentionally, what happens when a human does it deliberately? Interrupted by call from PALAK again, JAGAN finally leaves for home.</p>
