        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Delhi at dusk. High-rise silhouettes dissolve into dense smog. Roads are visible but almost empty; only a single car far in the distance, headlights off. Buildings feel tall, and slightly gloomy.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Discarded disposable masks on the road. One is caught in a shallow puddle, dark buildings in reflection. Science and Technology may have progressed considerably in India, yet it is used to old systems like disposable masks even as a pandemic ravages.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A modern commercial building stands under a sky that feels unnaturally low. Most windows are dark. A single window near the top is lit; small, isolated rectangle of light. The clouds create a halo like effect over the building; almost as if it is destined to be our savior.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>No stylized manga or western exaggeration. Every panel should feel like it could be a still frame from a live-action thriller.</li>
        <li>Silence is the dominant sound. Avoid visual clutter.</li>
        <li>Despite the severity of the pandemic imagined, we do not portray mass cremations which could risk upsetting some readers. </li>

        <p><strong>Shot:</strong> Wide / Establishing</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Inside a laboratory, JAGAN SHAH is standing with his hand on an executive chair at a desk which has computer workstation and some drawers. The monitor screen is blank. There is a chimpanzee with an electroencephalography (EEG) portable headset seated on a small reclined chair beside the desk. The chimpanzee is not interacting with the desk  and is behaving nicely (for the moment). The EEG headset it wears has wires protruding but they close back in. A black box is visible on the desk, function unclear.  </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> JAGAN is sitting down in the chair turning on the monitor. The monitor is displaying multiple electroencephalography signals. The chimpanzee is now out of frame, but its presence is implied through the flowing data.</p>
        <p><strong>Dialogue - JAGAN:</strong>
        &quot;THE PATTERN IS THERE...&quot;</p>

        <p><strong>Shot:</strong> Close-up</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> JAGAN yawning and stretching backward. A man who has slept too little for too long. His gaze is fixed slightly off-screen; not fully on the data.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Subtle facial realism. Emotions implied through posture and gaze, not by exaggerations.</li>
        <li>Keep the chimpanzee’s face subtly unsettling in Panel 1; avoid overt emotion.</li>
        <li>Panel 2 and Panel 3 should be side by side.</li>
        <li>Panel 4 should visually suggest hesitation: he says he should leave, yet remains seated.</li>

        <p><strong>Shot:</strong> Wide</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Rooftop at dusk. The city lies far below, already sinking into shadow. JAGAN is standing indifferent to a beautiful sun setting at the horizon, with the notebook in one hand and a pen in other hand. Warm wind tugs at his shirt. He is still; absorbed.</p>
        <p><strong>Dialogue - JAGAN:</strong>
        &quot;*uff*&quot;

        <p><strong>Shot:</strong> Close up</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Notebook page, clean and precise. Intricate neural network diagrams: nodes, layered pathways, wiring schematics drawn by hand with obsessive neatness. At the top of the page, handwritten title: MACHINE CONSCIOUSNESS. The lettering looks confident.</p>
        <p><strong>Dialogue - JAGAN (off-panel):</strong>
        &quot;THE NEURAL NETS ARE SIMULATING A CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IN THE LAB DEVICES...&quot;</p>

        <p><strong>Shot:</strong> Close up (slight shift)</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Another notebook page. Dense mathematical equations, machine learning symbols overlapping in places where corrections were made. Margins are crowded with arrows and small notes; evidence of iterative thinking, not chaos.</p>
        <p><strong>Dialogue - JAGAN (off-panel):</strong>
        &quot;… AND THE CHIMP&#39;S THOUGHTS ARE FINELY PASSING THROUGH THE TOKENIZER. YET, THE-&quot;</p>

        <h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Avoid trying to carry for all the intent in the script onto the illustrated page. Let visuals lose some of the intent.</li>
        <li>Keep notebook drawings grounded and believable; research-driven, not sci-fi ornamentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2 id="page-04">Page 04</h2>
        <p><strong>Narrative Function:</strong><br>Quiet marital tension. No overt conflict. Two intelligent adults speaking past each other. Contrasting domestic drama with JAGAN&#39;s intellectual obsession.</p>

        <h2 id="page-05">Page 05</h2>
        <p><strong>Narrative Function:</strong><br>Establish PALAK (ENTJ: Commander Personality Type) as emotionally grounded and quietly formidable; JAGAN (INTP: Logician Personality Type) as brilliant but drifting. UMANG (ESFJ: Consul Personality Type) anchors reality.</p>

        <p><strong>Narrative Function:</strong><br>JAGAN briefly recalls uncertainty about MAL (Machine Applications Laboratory, Ahmedabad), but does not linger considering what PALAK said; establishing him as a logical person.
